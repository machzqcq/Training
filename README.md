Training
========

I am using this project to help the community understand selenium webdriver with jruby
and the whole world of ruby gems (the same project works with MRI ruby too). I wil keep adding documentation as much as possible
however if you stumble across the code and want to know more, please email me: pradeep@seleniumframework.com
This project can be used by technical coaches for large and small companies to teach and also have
implementation code that proves Test Automation should be encouraged as much as possible
